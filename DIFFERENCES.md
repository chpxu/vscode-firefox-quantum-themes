# Differences

This lists known differences between this theme and current Firefox DevTools (as of 3rd September 2023)

1. HTML comments are not green.

   - Intentional: I do not consider if blocks in comments worth HTML being green.
   - Also they are not green if you view the html in "Debugger".

2. Bracket selection is not the same foreground colour.

   - This goes for error brackets and regular brackets.

3. CSS variables are not blue.

   - Intentional, to be able to distinguish properly since they are surrounded by purple and blue. May change though.
