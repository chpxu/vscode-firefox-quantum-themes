# Firefox Quantum Themes

The Firefox Quantum Themes for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) are inspired by the colours used in Firefox Quantum's DevTools. Using the exact same colours Mozilla use for the chrome and syntax highlighting in the DevTools, I've put together a beautifully dark and light theme. This theme is open-source and  will forever be open-source. Snyone is welcome to submit PRs, open issues etc. I would love to hear your feedback! Look below for more information. For Firefox Users, this theme will be especially pleasing to use!

## Contribution

I currently work on this theme in my spare time. As of writing, it is available in the Marketplace. As a new developer, I am still attempting to work things out, thanks!

If editing and wanting to submit a pull request, please ensure that as much sufficient detail is provided, and briefly state your changes and why, or if meant to fix an issue, reference the problem alongside it.

> Thanks for over 13,000 downloads! After 3 years I have decided this theme needs some improvement and TLC

### repo vs Marketplace
The marketplace version always contains the **stable** version of this theme. The repsitory here on GitHub also contains beta pushes. To run these beta pushes
1. Locate the  `.vscode\extensions` folder or `.vscode-insiders\extensions` if using the Insiders builds
2. Make a directory where you want to host this theme
3. Download the repo as a zip
4. Unzip, paste everything into the directory you created
5. Restart VSCode
6. You should see the themes "Firefox Quantum Dark" and "Firefox Quantum Light"
## Thank You's!

This theme was heavily inspired by Firefox DevTools, as well as the [One Dark Pro Port](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) and VSCode itself! Thanks to them all for the ideas :)

And the following:

- [**@compilenix**](https://github.com/compilenix): First person to show interest and BETA TESTER

- All of you who have even just glanced!


Note: I highly recommend having Colorized Bracket Pairs enabled and customised to your liking. It helps with bracket heavy languages, especially ones that aren't themable that well or you just end up writing a lot of brackets (LaTeX). I would not recommend setting the colours to the same ones as the theme (unless you want to do so), as this will make some merge with the keywords and thus make it harder to vsiaully locate brackets without the visualiser.
