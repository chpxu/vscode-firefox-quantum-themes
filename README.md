# Firefox Quantum Themes

This theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is inspired by the colours used in Firefox Quantum's DevTools. This theme is Open-Source and anyone is welcome to submit PRs, open issues etc. I would love to hear your feedback! Look below for more information. For Firefox Users, this theme will be especially pleasing to use!
